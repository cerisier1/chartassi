			<p>  Housing in New York City has remained a point of contention between New Yorkers and the city government for over a decade, but in the past three years we have seen this come to a head in a legislative, turned legal battle when the City Council sued Mayor Eric Adams earlier this year. </p>
		
			<p>At the center of it all is the new CityFHEPS housing voucher, the voucher is a consolidated version of several preexisting voucher programs meant to move more people from shelters to homes. However widespread voucher discrimination by landlords has made the voucher almost impossible to use. </p>
			<p>The ways landlords discrimination ranges from ghosting, administrative issues on the government’s end, or an outright  “no voucher accepted” rejection. </p>

            <iframe title="Top 3 District for Voucher Discrimination Per Borough" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-5upMS" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5upMS/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 35%; min-width: 70% !important; border: none;" height="587" data-external="1"></iframe>
        	<p>Currently in Brooklyn, which accounts for <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/endinghomelessness/downloads/pdf/brooklyn.pdf">36% of the shelter population</a> which has boomed an astonishing <a href="https://www.cssny.org/news/entry/state-supreme-court-ruling-puts-more-vulnerable-new-yorkers-at-risk-of-home">512.846% since 2021</a>  suffers from the highest rates of discrimination. City Council is trying to address this discrimination through a series of reforms making the vouchers easier to use, these reforms including eliminating the credit and background checks.</p>
			<p>According to Leo Lopez, homeless organizer with VOCAL New York, “Landlords are refusing to work with the Cityfephs voucher because its bureaucratically way too difficult… they just don’t think it's worth it.”.</p>
			<p>According to Legal Aid Society, after failing to push the reforms through in court City Council is following through with the appeal with the potential start date of November 26th, if the City does not request a delayed start.</p>
